    Looking for digital marketing assistance. You probably need a website. You may have a website, but it needs improvement or your customers just can't find it. Your website may be fine, but you need help building a social media presence that engages with existing and potential customers.

      Once you have accepted our proposal, it is time to clarify the details. At this stage, we will talk about the specific plan and timetable of the project, confirm the responsibilities and results, and discuss the approval process. We will review your existing content and provide feedback for additional requirements. To work with graphic design or photography beyond our capabilities, we can recommend reputable professionals.
      <br/><br/>
      For larger projects, we can organise meeting with key stakeholders. This allows us to dive deep into your brand, goals, customers, KPIs and make sure everyone is on the same page.

At the end of this phase, we will have the basics of your digital marketing strategy that will guide the rest of the process.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Content creation</h2>

      Content is just as important as design, but often overlooked.
      We believe that content drives design, not the other way around.
      <br/><br/>
      The design of the website will be appropriately tailored to your corporate identity and optimised for search engines, and in addition we will build a structural architecture that defines what information enters each individual page and how these pages should be linked.
      <br/><br/>
      When we work on SEO, we will conduct keyword research for your industry and audit the existing website for content, loading speed, and impressions. Online advertising is also heavily dependent on keyword research and we will identify the demographics we want to target using the most effective social platforms to do so.

Social media platforms vary greatly in how they display and prioritise content, so one of our first tasks is to tailor the content to each platform in order to maximise impact.Social media platforms vary greatly in how they display and prioritise content, so one of our first tasks is to tailor the content to each platform in order to maximise impact.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">Review and launch</h2>

  <div class='col-12 col-md-7'>
    <p>Once the results of the project are considered ready for the market, we conduct an in-depth review with your team, as well as all relevant external stakeholders. This includes fixes, validation of the User Experience, and testing of the functionality of multiple devices and browsers. Based on the feedback, we then refine and move on to the startup phase.
    <br/><br/>
    Depending on the nature of your project, launching itself can be explosive or based on a series of strategic steps. Traditional marketing supports the theory of learn-measure-build, but this approach takes time and we tend to prefer the Lean Startup model. Launch of Minimum Applicable Product. (MVP) "MVP is the product version that allows the team to gather the most customer feedback for their product with the least effort."
    </p>
    <p>We will help you decide which approach to adopt for your product or service and support you at the launch stage.</p>
